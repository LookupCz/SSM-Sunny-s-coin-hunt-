Anotace projektu CZE:

Udělat animovaný mini film podle mnou vybrané části z Shadow Slave Web Novely kde hlavní postava Sunless bojuje s monstrem jménem Mordant Mimic. Ohledně technické stránky, kamerové záběry budou primárně konceptem *filmové* z dálky, z blízka, atd. Taky bych rád zkusil zakomponovat pohled z první osoby. Chci to zpracovat dobře/správně kinematograficky. Se stylizací a vizuály budu experimentovat v průběhu vývoje, abych vše stihl.

Project annotation ENG:

To make an animated mini-movie based on my chosen part of the Shadow Slave Web Novella where the main character Sunless fights a monster named Mordant Mimic. On the technical side, the camera shots will be primarily a *movie* concept from a distance, close-ups, etc. I'd also like to try to incorporate a first-person view. I want to handle it well/correctly cinematically. I'll experiment with stylization and visuals during development to get everything done.

story intro ('drawn-ish, doodles'):

	Narrator: 
"In this world, people dread falling asleep because of a mysterious disease called the Spell that emerged 60 years ago. Each winter, it forces some into a deep sleep, pulling them into a Nightmare. Spells first terrifying challenge where waking up is not guaranteed." //20sec
	//
"Sunless, also known as Lost from Light, was one of the rare individuals who received his true name after just his first Nightmare, earning him the title of Sleeper. He was then forced to enter the Dream Realm for the first time, finding himself in a previously unknown place called the Forgotten Shore." //15-20sec
	//
"After over a year of relentless struggles, battles, and inevitable growth in swordsmanship, using his affinity for shadows, he returned to the Awake world as one of the strongest Awakened of his generation." //15sec
	//
"Now, he seeks to become even stronger. But in this world, nothing comes for free. What challenge has fate prepared for him next?" //15-20sec

// around 1min


anim start:

/418/
	//Sunny near the shipwreck
	//Sunny went into breach in the breaches in its hull
	//Then dove into shadows to be safe
		//To show off the shadow step ability i let him go in it then into a room of some sort
	//Sunny didn't know what the purpose of this room was, yet he was observant, he saw a lot of random debris and noticed thick brown vines covering the walls and ground

Sunny_M: "Oh, crap. Here we go again. 
				...Those are alive."

		//with a subtle shudder/anxious look he stared at the 
at the strange reddish-brown vines

	//out of nowhere strange feeling appeared in his lungs, he sighted, took piece of cloth from his pack, and wrapped it tightly around the lower part of his face

Sunny_M: "Blood Weave to he rescue! Let's see what's inside."

/419/
	//after only few steps something gleamed on the floor in front of him
	//bending down, Sunny picked up the small object
	//realized that is was Noctis Coin
	//put it in his bag and went on his way
	**//his suspicious growing when he saw all the vines and felt the murky air becoming much stronger. The warm breeze that blew through the wreck at rhythmic intervals reminded him of slow breathing of a slumbering giant. 

Sunny_M: "Let's, uh… not do anything to awake that thing"
	
	//wrapped both his shadows around his body
	//went on with exploring the wreck
	//stepped on moss, swayed

Sunny_L: "Argh..." //felt pain

	//feeling weak and weird while the poison entered his blood stream
		//blood weave anim-visualization as its clearing his blood of it

Narrator: "Sunny felt weak after inhaling the poison...With Blood Weave constantly destroying the poison that gets into his body, he'll be fine as long as he's able to endure the pain though" //10sec

		//sunny just had to endure the pain
		//limping, weird walk, etc.
		
	...//quick scene of him picking up coins (one camera angle of him getting closer to it while picking up the coins, 'tp-ing' over one and other) on his way

	//approached a wall with gate
	//staring at it he felt the shadows behind the gate (main storage room in the ship)

Narrator: "Sunny couldn’t sense any abominations lurking behind the large gate, but he remained cautious—there could always be something better at hiding than he was at looking." //10sec

	//felt big shadow (wormvine-soldane, dont care)

Sunny_M "Again, let's not awake that thing."

	//he said as he jumped up, grabbed the edges of the hole above him and climbed onto the exterior of the ship's hull
	//walked on the sloping hull of the ship, being careful not to step on any more vines
	//now he was approaching the shattered bow of the ship
	//crawled back inside and landed softly on carpet of moss
	//several golden coins were gleaming on the ground, with one more laying further down the dark corridor
	//sunny cautiously gathered them
		//(anxious, jittering, looking around)
	//moved deeper into the wreck
	//not long into it, found himself in the ships compartment, ships treasury
		//it just felt better, no moss, no vines, no poisonous spores in the air
	//smiled while standing in front of the door

Sunny_L: "...Eureka"

/420/
	//felt that there was nothing moving behind the door
		//wasn't entirely convinced 
	//sent one of his shadow in from under the door

Sunny_M: "How do I even open this thing?"
	
	//he said as he looked through his shadows eyes
		//shadow pov of the room
	//he smiled
	//stepped through his shadow and appeared in the treasure room
	//waited for few then studied the three chests standing in the middle of the room
		//all three were open, 2 stood empty
		//third...
		//his eyes widened in shock
	//as he looked on the third chest
		//big enough to fit an adult man
		//filled to the brim with heavy gold coins

Sunny_M: "Thousands...there are thousands of them"

		//his heart skipped a beat, and he swayed slighty

Narrator: "In front of him was a way to get instantly stronger, with these...Sunny would be able to make one or two whole new shadow cores...Probably"

Sunny_M: "This...this can't be true"

Narrator: "Sunny thought that this is way too easy... ...It wasn't, really. ...Almost dying while fighting monster that perfectly copied him and his abilities. Walking through darkness and inhaling paralyzing poison. ...No doubt he would've died if it weren't for his legacy of a daemon flowing through his veins"

		//Gulped, sight was so beautiful his eyes gleamed witch avarice

Sunny_M: "Don't mind if I do"

	//took several steps forward, approaching the chest	

Sunny_M: "Gold is heavy though, how do I carry all these coins back?"

	//he reached for the coins, then stopped suddenly
		//hand hovered just outside the chest's opening

Sunny_L: "Hmm..."
		//he frowned
	//

	//Narrator: "What"s wrong? There is no danger inside the treasury. Nor was there anything moving oustide of it."

Sunny_M: "The Chain Worm... ...He had the coins in his stomach but wood and metal strips as well. But WHY was it mortally wounded?"

		//POV scene: he looks at the two normal chests, were in normal condition with no part missing, then pan to the bigger one with the gold inside, quick pan to its corners, then stopping on one of the corners which seamed new, as in regenerated skin...

	//suddenly the chest lunged at him

/421/
Sunny_M: "What..." //quick what
	
	//Sunny recoiled (tried to flich his hand out of the monsters way)
		//golden coins moved revealing rows of triangular teeth
	//falling guillotine trying to bite his arm off
	//with quick reaction pulled up cruel sight with his other hand 
		//put it in between of the teeth and his forearm
			//just shattered his bones :)

Sunny_L: *painful scream*

	//caught in the mimics maw, with the CS laying flat on top of his arm
		//the lower teeth were slowly sinking into the vambrace of Puppeteer's Shroud

Sunny_M: "What the hell is this thing?!"

	//coins falling out of the monsters mouth, the maw pressing more and more on his hand

Sunny_L: "B-bastard let go of me." //aggitated and (angry OR little scared)

	//forcing sunny to fall to his knees
	//suddenly something wet and coarse touched his hand
		//long and wide tounge emerged from beneath the golden coins
	//then the tounge moved toward his neck

Sunny_L: "What the Spell?!"

	//second shadow wrapping around him
	//the mimic didn't even budge, its bite being too overbearing

Sunny_M: "Argh! Crap!" //angrily in pain
	
	//the tongue nearing his neck, he...
	//growled
	//turned Cruel Sight into spear, at the same time activated Dark Mirror enchantment
	//embuing the siver blade with soul-destroying power

	//the memory extended into the creature's mouth

Mimic: "shriek" //painful

	//as it felt the pain Sunny got his arm out

Sunny_L: "Yes" //triumphantly
	
	//before he could do anything else
	//suddenly the chest swayed, rose into the air, revealing it's body
		//more coins falling to the floor
	//then it towered above sunny, tongue dripping with saliva

Sunny_L: "Oh, Curse it a... (all)"

	//meanwhile saying that the monster kicked him in the sternum/chest
		//power of train
	//sunnys body shot back
	//smashed through the reinforced door that headed to the treasure room
	//rolled into the corridor outside

Sunny_M: "*Groaned*" //the air in his lungs was knocked out of his lungs tho

	//noticing the MM falling on all fours
	//launching itself forward
	//lid of the chest rising to get another bite
	//the lid close in the place where sunny stood
	
	//sunny shadow stepped away
	//appearing 10m further into the corridor

	//chest being confused, hovered in the air for a couple of seconds
	//then slowly turned to face him
	
	//he sighed, tried to stand up, failed
	
Sunny_L: "Come here, you bastard" //little crazed, deceitfully, in pain

	//used cruel sight to help himself stand up
	//then pointed the spear at the creature

	//the chest tilted to the side

Sunny_M: "This bastard is mocking me... how can chest even grin"

MMimic_L: *giggle* //high pitched grin, from somewhere inside it

Sunny_M: "Funny, is it?"

	//he smiled
	//lowered the spear slowly-ish
	//thrust it into one of the vines near his foot

Sunny_M: "Not so funny now, huh?"

	//meanwhile the creatures giggle stopped
	//it froze and stared at Sunny, stunned
	//trembled

	//then the entire ship trembled, too
	
/422/

	//the creature stared at him, mortified
	//its tongue retreating into its mouth

Sunny_L: "Goodness gracious. How clumsy of me." //sarcastically, maliciously

	//the monster gave him hateful look
	//looked at the doors of the treasury
	//halted, and looked at Sunny
		//i need to display the greed it has for him

	//suddenly the creature turned back to take a quick glance at Sunny
	//lunged at him

	//sunny shadow stepped, to the stop the monster jumped from

	//then he looked back at the corridor
	//watched in horror as the whole corridor started to move
	//vines started to crawl toward the confused mimi
	//long thorns appearing on their surface

	//biting into the mimic
	//him ripping them with talons, biting, etc
	
	//as he watched from the point the doors were at

Sunny_M: "Crap, crap, crap..." //fearfully

	//he started to go backwards, slowly
	//into the treasury
		//no vines, moss, only 2 chests and golden coins scattered on the ground
	//as he hesitated
	//mimic screeched
	//then suddenly appeared in the doorway
	
	//before sunny even fully summoned the Cruel Sight
	//the abomination was already over his head jumping in the middle of the room
	//then ran toward the breach in the ship

	//sunny saw everything, him being confused as it escaped the wreck

Sunny_L: "...Huh"

	//looked at the coins on the ground
	//and without any care for the incoming vines started to pickup the coins

Sunny_M: "If these are real, then those inside the chest are real as well ...they have to be"

	//as he continued picking up the last coins
	//his focus changed to the shadow he hid inside the mimic's one
		//split first person pov one eye from the mimic's shadow
		//one still focusing on the coin picking

		//or just the - pov one eye from the mimic's shadow

Sunny_L: "Where are you running, bastard!"

	//he said, as he threw his backpack with coins onto his back
	//with cruel sight in his hand
	//dove into the shadows
	//appearing in the monsters shadow
	//turning the cruel sight into it's sword version
	//then even before the mimic could react
	//he sliced it's thigh, the blade going all the way through
		//blood

	//it painfully shrieked
	//then the ground moved shaked
	//vines went through the moss (on the ground) and wrapped around the monsters body
	
	//one though, slid around Sunnys leg instead

/423/

Sunny_M: "Not good..."

	//sunny hacked at it with the Cruel Sight
	//his eyes widened
	//at the same time - the vine shredded the leather boot of the Puppeteer's Shroud
	//before the vine saw off his foot
	//he augmented cruel sight with both of his shadows
	//the short sword hacked through the vine

	//more were coming towards him
	//he turned to a shadow
	//then watched as the mimic stood up on its's all fours
	//dashed toward the edge of the island and tore the vines that were holding it down

Sunny_L: "*hissed* Crap!" //annoyed
Sunny_M: "Why couldn't it just lay still and die"

	//he escaped shadows then went after the abomination
	//just few seconds after he went out of the shadow
	//he saw the mimic jump off of the island

Sunny_L: "What the hell!" //

	//Sunny reached the edge a few seconds later
	//looked down
	//saw a heavenly chain
		//10km, rusted, stone structure collapsed, old
		//saw chain worms eating, being around the chain

	//then the monster landed directly on the chain

Sunny_L: "...Crap" //startled

	//dashed away, swaying as it went
	//sometimes falling on all fours, then lauching itself into the art	
	//jumping from one link to another
	//he hesitated

Narrator: "Sunny's prize was slipping away. The island ahead had to be Twisted Rock, with no land beyond and its heavenly chain on the verge of collapse. He wasn't sure what to do." //10sec

		//small island at the end of the rusted chain - Twisted Rock
	//he moved towards the edge still thinking
	//maybe_ watching the mimic tearing one chain worm apart, then tossing it into the Sky bellow
	//vines coming towards him

Narrator: "Risk it all or retreat and lose the treasure forever? Sunny had to decide now." //5sec
	

Sunny_M: "...Fine. Let's get those coins!"

	//summoned Dark Wing and dove into the empty abyss of the skies

Narrator: "This wasn't greed or logic driven choice. It was intuition. Twisted Rock seemed to pull him in, a feeling stronger than anything he'd experienced before. His [Fated] Attribute and Weaver's eyes let him sense the strings of fate, and this time, something about the island felt crucial to his destiny" //15-20sec

/424/

	//After falling/gliding for some time he landed on the chain
	//instantly going into shadow form under it

		//him not being noticed by any chain worms while riding the chain in shadow form

Sunny_M: "How do i kill that thing though? Broken hand is one thing, but with almost no shadow essence left, this will be tricky"
	
	//after a while
	//he caught up with the chest
	//continued to follow in shadows
	//the monster running still as fast as it could

		//fighting more chain worms
			//like 2 clips of it eating or tearing apart the worms
	
	//jumping from link to link
	//as he and the chest were halfway to the small island
	//they both heard something
	//the chains rattled

	//he froze for a moment, glanced at the goal of this journey
	//Twisted Rock had entered it's ascent phase, and now was rising quickly into the sky
		//still in shadow form

Sunny_M: "Curse it all!" //somber

	//continued to chase after the running/jumping monster
	//try to visualize shadow essence, running low

Sunny_M: "Damn it! ...I'm almost out of essence" //mad

	/as he continued to pursue the mimic and island
	//the angle of chain still increasing

Sunny_M: "...Was my intuition wrong?" //sorrowful, confused

	//soon, the two of them emerged from the darkness of the Sky Below
	//as soon as the sun started to hit the chains

Sunny_M: "I might be troubled now..." //cautiously
		//maybe_ scrap

	//he had to move one of his 2 shadows forward then shadow step into it
	//again and again
	//to not fall behind the monster

Narrator: "With almost no essence, a broken arm, no bursts of speed, strength and stamina, and no way to use Shadow Step, this clash was going to be tough." //8-10sec

	//looking at the chain worms dead, mangled bodies behind somewhere

Sunny_M: "I'm getting these coins, ....even if it kills me!" //

/425/

	//mimic drew close to the island
	//crouched near the vertical stone wall of the island
	//giggled
	//shot upward
	//jumping 20m+ high
	//its talons piercing the weathered stone
	//then nimbly climbing up
	//disappearing from Sunnys view
		//cam dynamic, closing up on the mimic as its climbing
		//semi-circling the mimic as its climbing at the same time

		//then pan on the chain again

	//Sunny emerging from shadows on the rusted chain
	//chain swaying as the island rose higher and higher
	//looked up on the edge of the island
	
	//summoned Prowling Thorn
	//cut one of the straps off his backpack
	//tied it around his neck to create makeshift sling
	//for his broken arm
	//then activated Dark Wing
	//used the Prowling Thorn
	//used it to fly up the overhanging slope of the stone island

	//used the gliding of Dark Wing and the throw and pulling technique with Prowling Thorn
	
	//as he pulled himself over the edge of the island
		//being in air above the island
		//before he could land smoothly 
	//the crushing pushed him down on the ground

	//crouched mimic heard his fall
	//froze
	//turned around and faced him
	//sunny scowled

	//mimic stared at Sunny
	//opened its maw
	//swallowed the remains of another chain worm he found, whole
		//half of the body already in mouth
		//tail and arm out
	//licked the blood off its sharp teeth
	//giggled, hatefully

	//cold smile appeared on Sunny's lips

Sunny_L: "Right back at you, bastard." //cold, hateful

	//the mimic rose to its feet (was on all fours beforehand)
	//towering above sunny

	//sunny changing cruel sight to its short sword base
	//the sword gleamed
	
	//heavenly chains rattled bellow
	//twisted rock continued to ascend

	//sunnys cold smile disappeared
	//staring at the monster
	//felt a bit of fear
		//camera view of sunnys back in front then the mimics front
		//stand off

Narrator: "Despite the suicidal odds, Sunny remained confident. The Blood Blossom amulet around his neck enhanced his powers, memories and shadows as enemies bled. Second, his polished technique and experience against larger foes gave him an edge. Most importantly, the monster’s massive size was a disadvantage on the Chained Isles, where being as small as Sunny was key due to the Crushing." //20-25sec //maybe redo in future

	//Sunny feeling the Crushing pressing on him more and more
	//raised his sword
	//aimed it at the monster

Sunny_L: "Who's gonna break first..."

/426/

	//the mimic shifted its weight,	
	//lunged forward with giggle
		//terrifying, powerful, telegraphed though
	//sunny diving under the arm
	//narrowly avoiding being torn apart
	//lashed out with the Cruel Sight
	//blade biting into abdomen of mimic
	//piercing tough skin just under mimics ribs
	//continued with momentum
	//spun
	//already behind enemy

	//at the same time
	//mimic pressed both hands on ground then kicked back with both legs

Narrator: "He knew how the monster fights from watching from afar, every move, every thing it done." //5sec
	//flashbacks of the mimic ripping chain worm in half, and one clip of mimic biting down on one
"...He also studied the creatures tendencies and likes. Also where it's most vulnerable, the body" //6-7sec
	//as he avoided the kick and again sliced at the monsters body
	//it bleeding more 
		//visualization of the Blood Blossom
			//raging with red in his eyes and/or the amulet flashing vibrant red
"Sunny's natural perceptiveness, sharpened by practicing Shadow Dance, allowed him to quickly learn about the fiend." //5-7sec

	//the mimic  bending its joints in the oposite directions
	//on all fours
	//the lid of the chest serving as a lower jaw

	//sunny jumped down under the attacking fiend
	//striking the monsters leg again, leaving a deep scar
	//at the same time, sharp pain radiated through sunnys entire body
		//bones in his arm scraping against eachother

Sunny_M: "That is going to hurt..."

	//as the fiend pivoted
	//snapped one of its limbs in his direction

	//sunny sent both his shadows to streghten the Puppeteer's Shroud

	//the talons slashed across sunnys torso
	//slid away, without piercing it

	//the still powerful strike still have thrown sunny back
	//landing on his legs
		//as he had prepared
	//supressed groan
	//brandinshed the Cruel Sight once again
		//camera at sunny
		//rattling sound
		
		//camera switch on chain worms eating the chain
	//the heavenly chain rattled again as the island rose
	//the Crushing becoming more and more of a problem for sunny

		//camera switch to sunnys face, sweat, blood
	//sunny on the verge on passing out

Sunny_L: "Argh! Curse you!" //hateful, exhausted

	//he staggered back
	//used the shaft of Cruel Sight to keep standing straight
	//smirk came up on his face

		//camera on mimic
	//mimic not looking good either
	//the fight was longer than both of them expected

	//sunny bleeding from several wounds
	//mimics body looked like it went through a meat grinder
	//its tongue, hanging lifelessly over the edge of the chest

	//mimic giggled again
		//tired, confused, with hatred in eyes
		//red gleaming in camera
	//going forward
	//trying to swipe at sunny with one hand
	//as it did, missed
	//crashed on the ground instead
	//lying there motionlessly
	//let out discouraged growl
	
	//sunny not sure if he'll be able to take another step
	//extending Cruel Sight to its full length
	//thrusting it forward
	//piercing the skin of the fiend
	//black blood seeping out

Sunny_M: "Good, this is good....bleed to death you piece of crap!"

	//blood blossom becoming a bit stronger
		//visualization - the amulet flashing red
	
	//the fiend tried to dodge the attack, failed
	//trying to stand up, failed
		//the Crushing's pressure visualization as it's trying to stand/get up

	//sunny smiled

Sunny_M: "Got you..."

	//retrieving his spear, thrusting it again
	//again
	//and again
		//few times, 8+

Sunny_L: "Die,... just die already..." //desperately, tired

	//the fiend giggled mockingly
	//suddenly gathered its limbs
	//limbs disappearing into the bottom of the chest
	
	//few seconds later
	//only the indestructible chest standing now
	
	//tip of the spear scraping against the wood
	//not even leaving scratches

	//sunny dumbfounded
	//fell to his knees as the power of the Crushing increased even further

Sunny_L: "No,... Come back here, you coward"

	//his hands trembled
	//lifting the spear
	//trying to damage the chest
	
	//the lid of the chest trembled
	//then rose a bit
	//hateful giggle emerged from its mouth

	//at the same time
	//sunny tossed a polished crimson gem
	//that appeared in his hand toward the chest
	//Broken Oath flew inside the abomination's mouth

	//the lid snapped close
	//pressed down by the Crushing
	//muffled sound resounded from within the chest
	//the lid couldn't opened again

	//sunny falling to the ground
	//crawling out of the range of Broken Oath
	//then he grinned

Sunny_L: "Who's laughing now? Try to swallow that, you bastard..."

/427/

		//camera pov of both laying on the ground, only few meters away from eachother, then pan on the chest, losing color, getting rusted, then it switches to look at sunny, him laying on the hard stone, looking at the sky, struggling to breathe
			//his armor soaked in blood
			//his broken arm pressed tightly against his chest
			//his face deadly pale
				//visualization of Blood Weave, he cant bleed out
		//as the blood weave pulses inside of his heart - vizualization

Narrator: "Sunny knew he wouldn’t bleed out, thanks to Blood Weave, but his broken arm and battered body needed attention. The Crushing made things worse; until Twisted Rock fully expanded, he risked being crushed. His two shadows eased the pressure, but with low essence, even diving into the shadows to flee was a risky option."
	//15-20sec

		//just panning from different angles of the island, both being on the ground
		//nothing just waiting for 10-20sec of just sunny breathing
			//make it so we too wait for the mimic to die of the soul damage

Sunny_M: "Oh god, how much longer will this take? Are the soul-destroying powers of the Broken Oath that weak, or is the chest immune?"

Sunny_M: "Why even am I here? What makes this island so special? Why did the strings of fate pointed me to this? Why did my intuition react so strongly? There is nothing here."

	//mimic made a sound
	//first crack appeared, black blood spilling
	//another one...

Sunny_M: "Finally..."

	//as another cracks appeared
	//more blood pooling under it
	
	//sunny enduring pain
	//the Crushing still becoming stronger

	//the creature trembled after more cracks appeared
	//giggled one last time, hateful
	//then grew absolutely still

	//sunny grinned

	//it was dead

Sunny_M: "Finally... all those coins... are mine"

	//As the heavenly chain rattled and groaned, the voice of the Spell resounded above the hellish stone island. Its words sounded like music to his ears... 

Speel: "[You have slain a Fallen Devil, Mordant Mimic.]"

Speel: "[Your shadow grows stronger.]"

Speel: "[...You have received a Memory.]"
